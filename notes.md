# Routing Notes

## Remember:
> Write code for Humans!

## Terminology

Separation of Concerns answers _"who should be doing this?"_

## Routing

- use it to break up an application/API into sub applications
- picking the code to execute based on URL and HTTP Method
- used for managing sub resources (the comments on a blog post, for example)

## Query String Parameters

The client can send data to the server inside: 
- body
- URL parameters
- query string parameters (part of the URL)
- ? (Headers)
